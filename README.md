# ðŸ’³ Credit Scoring Model

A machine learning-based system to predict whether a person is creditworthy based on key financial indicators such as income, debt, and payment history.


# Project Overview

This project uses supervised classification techniques to evaluate credit risk. It supports user input at runtime and provides model evaluation with accuracy, classification report, and ROC-AUC score.


# âœ… Features

- Models used:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
- Evaluation metrics:
  - Accuracy Score
  - Classification Report
  - ROC-AUC Score
- Real-time user input for live predictions


# Input Fields

- `Income` (e.g., 60000)
- `Debt` (e.g., 15000)
- `Payment History`:  
  `1 = Good`, `0 = Poor`
